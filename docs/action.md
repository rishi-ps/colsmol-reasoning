# ICDAR 2026 Abstract Submission - Plan of Action

## Objective
Submit the ICDAR 2026 abstract today with complete metadata, fixed authorship, and a clean abstract text.

## Hard Deadline
- Abstract deadline: **February 13, 2026, 23:59 AOE**
- US conversion:
  - **February 14, 2026, 06:59 EST**
  - **February 14, 2026, 03:59 PST**

## Submission Strategy (Today)
1. **Lock scope and claims (30-45 min)**
   - Keep the abstract claim set minimal and defensible.
   - Remove placeholders (`[Δv1]`, `[Δv2-EN]`, `[Δv2-All]`, `[Δv3]`).
   - If final metrics are not locked, switch to qualitative phrasing.

2. **Freeze authorship and metadata (20-30 min)**
   - Confirm exact author names, order, and affiliations.
   - Confirm corresponding author email.
   - Decide primary topic/keywords for the ICDAR track form.
   - Note: ICDAR states authorship is final after submission.

3. **Prepare submission packet (20-30 min)**
   - Final abstract text (paste-ready).
   - Paper title (stable working title is fine).
   - Author list + affiliations.
   - Keywords/topics.
   - Any required declarations in CMT form.

4. **Submit in CMT early (15-20 min)**
   - Enter metadata and abstract.
   - Save and submit at least 1-2 hours before your local converted deadline.
   - Capture proof: screenshot confirmation and submission ID.

5. **Immediate post-submit check (10 min)**
   - Verify submitted title/abstract/authors in CMT.
   - Verify all co-authors can see the submission record (if needed).

## Suggested Same-Day Timeline (example, US local)
1. T-4h: Lock abstract text and claims.
2. T-3h: Confirm authorship and affiliations.
3. T-2h: Complete CMT entry and submit.
4. T-90m: Verify confirmation + backup screenshots.
5. T-60m onward: Return to experiments for full paper.

## Abstract Draft Fixes Before Submission
- Keep:
  - Problem framing (small retrievers vs large models).
  - Two-method contribution (R2R + MID).
  - Benchmark coverage (ViDoRe v1/v2 EN+All/v3).
  - Controlled baselines (no-trace, shuffled-trace).
- Fix now:
  - Replace delta placeholders with:
    - final numbers, or
    - non-numeric claim wording (if numbers are still running).
  - Ensure wording does not overclaim beyond completed results.

## Minimal Risk Checklist
- [ ] Abstract has no placeholders.
- [ ] Author order and affiliations are final.
- [ ] CMT submission completed before local converted deadline.
- [ ] Confirmation screenshot + submission ID saved.
- [ ] A local copy of submitted abstract text is stored in repo/docs.

## Next Milestone
- Full paper deadline: **February 27, 2026, 23:59 AOE**.
- Start full-paper drafting immediately after abstract submission.
